Understanding the Code: A Simple Assembler and Simulator
Code Breakdown:
This C++ code implements a basic assembler and simulator for a simple instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA supports a limited set of instructions:
•	AND: Performs a bitwise AND operation on a register and a value.
•	OR: Performs a bitwise OR operation on a register and a value.
•	XOR: Performs a bitwise XOR operation on a register and a value.
Code Functionality:
1.	Assembly:
o	The assemble function reads assembly code from an input file (instructions.txt).
o	It translates each assembly instruction into machine code using a predefined opcode map.
o	The machine code is written to an output file (machine_code.txt).
2.	Simulation:
o	The readInstructions function reads the machine code from the output file.
o	The executeInstruction function interprets each machine code instruction and performs the corresponding operation on the register file.
o	The main function initializes the register file and program counter, and then enters a loop to fetch, decode, and execute instructions until a HALT instruction is encountered.
Key Components:
•	Instruction Structure: Defines the format of an instruction, including opcode and operands.
•	Opcode Map: Maps assembly instructions to their corresponding machine code opcodes.
•	Register File: An array of registers to store values.
•	Program Counter: Keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed.
Limitations and Potential Improvements:
•	Fixed Register File Size: The register file size is fixed.
•	Lack of Error Handling: The code doesn't handle errors like invalid instructions or out-of-bounds memory accesses.
•	No Memory Model: The code doesn't implement a memory model.
Potential Improvements:
•	Expand the ISA: Add more instructions like conditional branches, jumps, and function calls.
•	Implement a Memory Model: Allow instructions to access and modify memory.
•	Add Error Handling: Check for invalid instructions and memory accesses.
