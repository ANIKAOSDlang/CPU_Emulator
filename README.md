Outline the features of virtual CPU:
1.Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):
    ● Define basic instructions :
           ADD: Adds the contents of a memory location to the accumulator.
           SUB: Subtracts the contents of a memory location from the accumulator.
           LOAD: Loads the contents of a memory location into the accumulator.
           STORE: Stores the contents of the accumulator into a memory location.
     ● Createing a simple assembler to convert assembly code into machine code.
 2.Implementing core components of the CPU:
       ●  ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
       ●  general-purpose registers.
       ●  program counter and instruction register.
3. Developing  the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle:
        ●fetching mechanism.
        ● Decoding instructions and execute them using the ALU and registers.
 4. Implementing memory management for the virtual CPU:
         ● Setting up a simulated memory space and memory read/write operations.
         ● Handling address mapping and memory segmentation.
 5.Enable basic input/output operations:
         ● simulated I/O devices (keyboard, display), and integrate them.
         ● Test with I/O-intensive programs.
6. Adding advanced CPU features:
       ●  branching and control flow instructions and addsupport for subroutines and interrupts
       ● Integrate a simple pipeline mechanism.
7.Optimizing the emulator for better performance:
         ● Profile the emulator to identify bottlenecks, Optimize critical code paths.
         ● Enhance the assembler for better instruction encoding.
8.Thoroughly test and debug the emulator:
        ● Test with a variety of assembly programs.
        ● Debug and fix any issues.
        ● Validate performance against benchmarks.
